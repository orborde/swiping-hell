$M$: number of men
$W$: number of women
$p_M$: fraction of women that appeal to a given man
$p_W$: fraction of men that appeal to a given woman
$C$: Cost of deciding whether to swipe on a given profile

### Method A (men swipe first)
$$CostPerPerson_A = \frac{MWC + p_M M W C}{M+W}$$
### Method B (women swipe first)
$$CostPerPerson_B = \frac{MWC + p_W M W C}{M+W}$$

### Difference
$$CostPerPerson_A - CostPerPerson_B$$
$$\frac{MWC}{M+W} [p_M - p_W]$$
Let $M = W$ for sake of argument:
$$\frac{MMC}{M+M} [p_M - p_W]$$
$$\frac{1}{2} M C [ p_M - p_W]$$
